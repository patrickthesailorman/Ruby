# Modules

=begin
Extracting common methods to a superclass, like we did in the previous section, is a great way to model concepts that are naturally hierarchical (a Cat is an Animal which is a Mammal).
Another way of grouping methods together are modules.
A module is a collection of methods that can be used in other classes (think about them as libraries providing common functionality).
Modules are defined using the module keyword followed by the module name, which should start with a capital letter.
For example:
=end

module Flyable
  def fly
    puts "I'm flying!"
  end
end

=begin
The code above declares a module called Flyable, which includes one method called "fly".
A module can include as many methods as you want.
As you can see the syntax is very similar to defining classes.
But why use modules instead of classes? Tap Continue to discover!

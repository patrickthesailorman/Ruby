# Operator Overloading

# Ruby allows us to overload operators so that we can perform operations such as adding two objects together.
# Let's say we have a class Shape, which has width and height properties. We want to be able to add together two Shape objects and, as a result, get a new object that has its width and height equal to the sum of the corresponding properties of the objects.
# All we need to do is define the corresponding operator as a method:
class Shape
  attr_accessor :h, :w
  def initialize(h, w)
    self.h = h
    self.w = w
  end

  def +(other)
    Shape.new(self.h+other.h, self.w+other.w)
  end

end

a = Shape.new(7, 4)
b = Shape.new(9, 18)
c = a+b
puts c.h # outputs 16
puts c.w # outputs 22

# As you can see, the + method takes one argument, which is another Shape object, and returns a new Shape object with the corresponding values.
# You can override almost all operators in Ruby and have any custom logic defined in the corresponding method.

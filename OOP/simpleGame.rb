# A Simple Game

# Object Oriented Programming is very useful when it comes to creating complex applications, such as games.
# Let's create a simple fighting game, where two opponents will fight until one of them loses. 
# We start by creating our Player class:

class Player
  attr_accessor :name, :health, :power
  def initialize(n, h, pow)
    @name = n
    @health = h
    @power = pow
  end
  def isAlive
    @health > 0
  end
  def hit(opponent)
    opponent.health -= self.power
  end
  def to_s
    "#{name}: Health: #{health}, Power: #{power}"
  end
end

=begin
The Player class has 3 instance variables, name, health and power, and 3 instance methods:
isAlive shows whether the player is still alive.
hit hits the opponent (decreases the opponent's health by the amount of player's power)
to_s outputs the player information.
We have also defined getter and setter accessors for the instance variables using the attr_accessor method.
=end
